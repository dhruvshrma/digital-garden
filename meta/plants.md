# What plants in my garden?

As I mentioned earlier, I end up reading and listening to a great many things over the course of the day. While I was doing my Ph.D this was mostly scientific papers and the financial news. Currently, my reading is more eclectic and I also spend some time listening to podcasts. Enumerating the various sources of knowlegde, as I do below, will serve as the first step in the _file/folder_ hierarchy that I am going for in this garden.

1. **Articles online**: Whenever I come across an interesting article, I end up inevitably saving it to Pocket. 
2. **Podcasts**: They have been an immense source of knowledge and information for many years now. I might even write a separate blog post on my primary website about the various podcasts I listen to. 
3. **Wikipedia**: Since I participate in quizzes quite a bit, I end up skimming through a lot of wikipedia as well. 
4. **Books**: These will form a decent chunk of my reading going forward. I use different devices and formats so further sub-division makes sense:

    i. Paper books: Notes here would definitely fall into the evergreen category since I feel that I just end up being more focused with paper books. 

    ii. EBooks: Most of my fiction reading is on my Kindle. I retrieve my annotations from Kindle ebooks through the [Clippings](https://github.com/dhruvshrma/digital-garden/tree/17773253ca0839da58854022bd23c92ec76adbd0/introduction/clippings.io) website.

    iii. On the computer: These are mostly textbooks or research volumes. 

    iv. Audiobooks: Again mostly fiction. 

5. **Music**: Mostly spotify. One might think that there aren't any "notes" to be taken while listening to music, I would ideally like to take note of what I am listening to and better train my ear to differentiate between different instruments and composers. 
6. **TV Series**: Netflix, Amazon Prime and the like. 
7. **Documentaries**: I watch my fair share of documentaries. The idea of evergreen notes would be most valuable here since I won't be taking notes while watching. 
8. **Youtube Videos**: Youtube has become a great source for learning and discovering new things.
