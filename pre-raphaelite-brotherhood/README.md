# Pre-raphaelite Brotherhood

The Pre-Raphaeliteb brotherhood was a secret society founded in London in 1848. They opposed the Royal Academy's promotion of Raphael and wanted to go back to medieval subject matters. Embracing the style from the Italian Quattrocento period, their objective was to revitalize art through emphasis on a detailed observation of the natural world, with an almost religious devotion to the truth. 

Considering themselves to be a reform movement, with support from the influential art critic John Ruskin, they founded periodicals most notably _The Germ._ 

The founding members of the movement were [William Holman Hunt](william-holman-hunt.md), John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti.
