# William Holman Hunt

One of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite movement, or Brotherhood as they liked to call themselves. Was heavily influenced by the writings of John Ruskin, the influential art critic, and Thomas Carlyle, the historian. 

One of his most famous paintings is _The Awakening Conscience._ This painting shows a young woman rising suddenly from the lap of her lover \(suitor\). The painting has a very tapestry like feel to me, given the color palette that Hunt has chosen for this work.
