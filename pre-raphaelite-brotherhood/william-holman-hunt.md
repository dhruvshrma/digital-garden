# William Holman Hunt

One of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite movement, or Brotherhood as they liked to call themselves. Was heavily influenced by the writings of John Ruskin, the influential art critic, and Thomas Carlyle, the historian. 

One of his most famous paintings is _The Awakening Conscience._ This painting shows a young woman rising suddenly from the lap of her lover \(suitor\). The painting has a very tapestry like feel to me, given the color palette that Hunt has chosen for this work.

Another important painting from Hunt is titled _The Light of the World_. In this painting, Jesus is shown to be knocking on the door, but the perspective seems to suggest that the door is opening towards the inside. This makes reference to the passage from the Bible, Revelations 3:20 

> Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me.

This illustrates that we must allow God to come into our hearts.
