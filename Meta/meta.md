Let me discuss a few details about how I plan to create this garden 

## Tending the garden

How does one tend to a digital garden? My research into digital gardens led me to digital notes by [Andy Matsuchak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) where he suggests the use of [**Evergreen Notes**](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be). These are notes that aren't taken just at the spur of the moment, but are created through deep reflection and thought. These notes will of course build upon "rougher" notes that you accumulate over time. 

This is the approach that I wish to adopt as well. To start off, I think I will proceed in 2 steps. First step, would be to take rough notes about whatever I am reading or listening to. This could be in the form of highlights or hand-written notes. In the next step, I would take the time to condense these notes into a coherent whole. For purposes of archiving, I will be saving the preliminary, rougher notes as well.
